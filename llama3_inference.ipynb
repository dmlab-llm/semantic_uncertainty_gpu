      "We report the first $BV$ light curves and high-resolution spectra of the post-mass transfer binary star WASP 0131+28 to study the absolute properties of extremely low-mass white dwarfs. From the observed spectra, the double-lined radial velocities were derived, and the effective temperature and rotational velocity of the brighter, more massive primary were found to be $T_{\\rm eff,1} = 10,000 \\pm 200$ K and $v_1\\sin$$i$ = 55 $\\pm$ 10 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The combined analysis of the {\\it TESS} archive data and ours yielded the accurate fundamental parameters of the program target. The masses were derived to about 1.0 \\% accuracy and the radii to 0.6 \\%, or better. The secondary component's parameters of $M_2 = 0.200 \\pm 0.002$ M$_\\odot$, $R_2 = 0.528 \\pm 0.003$ R$_\\odot$, $T_{\\rm eff,2}$ = 11,186 $\\pm$ 235 K, and $L_2 = 3.9 \\pm 0.3$ L$_\\odot$ are in excellent agreement with the evolutionary sequence for a helium-core white dwarf of mass 0.203 M$_\\odot$, and indicates that this star is halfway through the constant luminosity phase. The results presented in this article demonstrate that WASP 0131+28 is an EL CVn eclipsing binary in a thin disk, which is formed from the stable Roche-lobe overflow channel and composed of a main-sequence dwarf with a spectral type A0 and a pre-He white dwarf.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "A possible origin of kHz QPOs in low-mass X-ray binaries is proposed. Recent numerical MHD simulations of accretion disks with turbulent magnetic fields of MRI definitely show the presence of two-armed spiral structure in quasi-steady state of accretion disks. In such deformed disks, two-armed ($m=2$) c-mode ($n=1$) oscillations are excited by wave-wave resonant instability. Among these excited oscillations, the fundamental in the radial direction ($n_r=0$) will be the higher kHz QPO of a twin QPOs, and the first overtone ($n_r=1$) in the radial direction will be the lower kHz QPO of the twin. A possible cause of the twin high-frequency QPOs (HFQPOs) in BH X-ray binaries is also discussed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Context. The relative importance of AC and DC heating in maintaining the temperature of the corona is not well constrained. Aims. Investigate the effects of the characteristic time scales of photospheric driving on the injection and dissipation of energy within a coronal arcade. Methods. We have conducted three dimensional MHD simulations of foot point driving imposed on an arcade. We modified the typical driving time scales to understand the efficiency of heating obtained using AC and DC drivers. We considered the implications for the injected Poynting flux and the nature of the energy release in dissipative regimes. Results. For the same driver amplitude and complexity, long time scale motions are able to inject a much greater Poynting flux into the corona. Consequently, in non-ideal regimes, slow stressing motions result in a greater increase in plasma temperature than for wave-like driving. In dissipative simulations, Ohmic heating is found to be much more significant than viscous heating. For all drivers in our parameter space, energy dissipation is greatest close to the base of the arcade where the magnetic field strength is strongest and at separatrix surfaces, where the field connectivity changes. Across all simulations, the background field is stressed with random foot point motions (in a manner typical of DC heating studies) and even for short time scale driving, the injected Poynting flux is large given the small amplitude flows considered. For long time scale driving, the rate of energy injection was comparable to the expected requirements in active regions. The heating rates were found to scale with the perturbed magnetic field strength and not the total field strength. Conclusions. Alongside recent studies which show power within the corona is dominated by low frequency motions, our results suggest that in the closed corona, DC heating is more significant than AC heating.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac objects (EHBLs) are an emerging class of blazars with exceptional spectral properties. The non-thermal emission of the relativistic jet peaks in the spectral energy distribution (SED) plot with the synchrotron emission in X-rays and with the gamma-ray emission in the TeV range or above. These high photon energies may represent a challenge for the standard modeling of these sources. They are important for the implications on the indirect measurements of the extragalactic background light, the intergalactic magnetic field estimate, and the possible origin of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of the multi-wavelength spectra of 32 EHBL objects detected by the Swift-BAT telescope in the hard X-ray band and by the Fermi-LAT telescope in the high-energy gamma-ray band. The source sample presents uniform spectral properties in the broad-band SEDs, except for the TeV gamma-ray band where an interesting bimodality seems to emerge. This suggests that the EHBL class is not homogeneous, and a possible sub-classification of the EHBLs may be unveiled. Furthermore, in order to increase the number of EHBLs and settle their statistics, we discuss the potential detectability of the 14 currently TeV gamma-ray undetected sources in our sample by the Cherenkov telescopes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We present results from a high-resolution, cosmological, $\\Lambda$CDM simulation of a group of field dwarf galaxies with the \"superbubble\" model for clustered SN feedback, accounting for thermal conduction and cold gas evaporation. The initial conditions and the galaxy formation physics, other than SN feedback, are the same as in Shen et al. (2014). The simulated luminous galaxies have blue colors, low star formation efficiencies and metallicities, and high cold gas content, reproducing the observed scaling relations of dwarfs in the Local Volume. Bursty star formation histories and superbubble-driven outflows lead to the formation of kpc-size DM cores when stellar masses reaches $M_{*} > 10^6$ $M_{\\odot}$, similar to previous findings. However, the superbubble model appears more effective in destroying DM cusps than the previously adopted \"blastwave\" model, reflecting a higher coupling efficiency of SN energy with the ISM. On larger scale, superbubble-driven outflows have a more moderate impact: galaxies have higher gas content, more extended stellar disks, and a smaller metal-enriched region in the CGM. The two halos with $M_{vir} \\sim 10^9$ $M_{\\odot}$, which formed ultra-faint dwarf galaxies in Shen et al. (2014), remain dark due to the different impact of metal-enriched galactic winds from two nearby luminous galaxies. The column density distributions of H I, Si II, C IV and O VI are in agreement with recent observations of CGM around isolated dwarfs. While H I is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within the CGM, Si II and C IV are less extended. O VI is more extended, but its mass is only 11% of the total CGM oxygen budget, as the diffuse CGM is highly ionised by the UVB. Superbubble feedback produces C IV and O VI an order of magnitude higher column densities than those with blastwave feedback. The CGM and DM cores are most sensitive probes of feedback mechanisms.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "While the width-luminosity relation (WLR) among type Ia supernovae (slower is brighter) is one of the best studied properties of this type of events, its physical basis has not been identified convincingly. The 'luminosity' is known to be related to a clear physical quantity -- the amount of $^{56}$Ni synthesized, but the 'width' has not been quantitatively linked yet to a physical time scale. We show that the recombination time of $^{56}$Fe and $^{56}$Co from doubly to singly ionized states causes the typical observed break in the color curve B-V due to a cliff in the mean opacities, and is a robust width measure of the light curve, which is insensitive to radiation transfer uncertainties. A simple photospheric model is shown to predict the recombination time to an accuracy of $\\sim5$ days, allowing a quantitative understanding of the color WLR. Two physical times scales of the width luminosity relation are shown to be set by two column densities -- the total column density which sets the gamma-ray escape time $t_0$ (previous Paper I) and the $^{56}$Ni column density which sets the recombination time (this Paper II). Central detonations of sub-$\\rm M_{ch}$ WDs and direct WD collision models have gamma-ray escape times and recombination times which are consistent with observations across the luminosity range of type Ia's. Delayed detonation Chandrasekhar mass models have recombination times that are broadly consistent with observations, with tension at the bright end of the luminosity range and inconsistent gamma-ray escape times at the faint end.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Stars of low and intermediate mass that exhibit oscillations may show tens of detectable oscillation modes each. Oscillation modes are a powerful to constrain the internal structure and rotational dynamics of the star, hence tool allowing one to obtain an accurate stellar age. The tens of thousands of solar-like oscillators that have been discovered thus far are representative of the large diversity of fundamental stellar properties and evolutionary stages available. Because of the wide range of oscillation features that can be recognized in such stars, it is particularly challenging to properly characterize the oscillation modes in detail, especially in light of large stellar samples. Overcoming this issue requires an automated approach, which has to be fast, reliable, and flexible at the same time. In addition, this approach should not only be capable of extracting the oscillation mode properties of frequency, linewidth, and amplitude from stars in different evolutionary stages, but also able to assign a correct mode identification for each of the modes extracted. Here we present the new freely available pipeline FAMED (Fast and AutoMated pEak bagging with DIAMONDS), which is capable of performing an automated and detailed asteroseismic analysis in stars ranging from the main sequence up to the core-Helium-burning phase of stellar evolution. This, therefore, includes subgiant stars, stars evolving along the red giant branch (RGB), and stars likely evolving toward the early asymptotic giant branch. In this paper, we additionally show how FAMED can detect rotation from dipolar oscillation modes in main sequence, subgiant, low-luminosity RGB, and core-Helium-burning stars. FAMED can be downloaded from its public GitHub repository (https://github.com/EnricoCorsaro/FAMED).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "ABRIDGED: 2D spectroscopic MUSE data for the whole extent of NGC3132 have been reduced and analised. The dust extinction, electron densities and temperatures of the ionised gas and abundances were determined. The nebula presents a complex reddening structure with high values (c(Hb)~0.4) at the rim. Density maps are compatible with an inner high-ionisation plasma at moderate high density (~1000cm^-3) while the low-ionisation plasma presents a structure in density peaking at the rim with values ~700 cm^-3. Median Te using different diagnostics decreases according to the sequence [NII],[SII]->[SIII]->[OI]->HeI->PJ. Likewise the range of Te covered by recombination lines is much larger than those obtained from CELs, with large spatial variations within the nebula. If these differences were due to the existence of high density clumps, these spatial variations suggest changes in the properties and/or distribution of the clumps within the nebula. We determined a median He/H=0.124. The range of measured ionic abundances for light elements are compatible with literature values. Our kinematic analysis nicely illustrates the power of 2D kinematic information in many emission lines to shed light on the intrinsic structure of the nebula. Our derived velocity maps support a geometry for the nebula similar to the previously propose diabolo model, but oriented with its major axis at P.A.~-22^o. We identified two low-surface brightness arc-like structures towards the northern and southern tips of the nebula, with high extinction, high helium abundance, and strong low-ionisation emission lines. They are spatially coincident with some extended low-surface brightness mid-IR emission. The characteristics of the features are compatible with being the consequence of precessing jets caused by the binary star system. This study illustrates the enormous potential of IFS for the study of Galactic PNe.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Dedicated surveys using different detection pipelines are being carried out at multiple observatories to find more Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Understanding the efficiency of detection algorithms and the survey completeness function is important to enable unbiased estimation of the underlying FRB population properties. One method to achieve end-to-end testing of the system is by injecting mock FRBs in the live data-stream and searching for them blindly. Mock FRB injection is particularly effective for machine-learning-based classifiers, for which analytic characterisation is impractical. We describe a first-of-its-kind implementation of a real-time mock FRB injection system at the upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) and present our results for a set of 20,000 mock FRB injections. The injections have yielded clear insight into the detection efficiencies and have provided a survey completeness function for pulse width, fluence and DM. Mock FRBs are recovered with uniform efficiency over the full range of injected DMs, however the recovery fraction is found to be a strong function of the width and Signal-to-Noise (SNR). For low widths ($\\lesssim 20$ ms) and high SNR ($\\gtrsim$ 9) the recovery is highly effective with recovery fractions exceeding 90%. We find that the presence of radio frequency interference causes the recovered SNR values to be systematically lower by up to 20% compared to the injected values. We find that wider FRBs become increasingly hard to recover for the machine-learning-based classifier employed at UTMOST. We encourage other observatories to implement live injection set-ups for similar testing of their surveys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We present high-quality ALMA Band 8 observations of the [CI] $^3P_1$-$^3P_0$ line and 609 $\\mu$m dust continuum emission toward the nearby luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) IRAS F18293-3413, as well as matched resolution (300-pc scale) Band 3 CO $J=$1-0 data, which allow us to assess the use of the [CI] $^3P_1$-$^3P_0$ line as a total gas mass estimator. We find that the [CI] line basically traces structures detected in CO (and dust), and a mean (median) [CI]/CO luminosity ($L'_{\\rm [CI]}$/$L'_{\\rm CO}$) ratio of 0.17 (0.16) with a scatter of 0.04. However, a pixel-by-pixel comparison revealed that there is a radial $L'_{\\rm [CI]}$/$L'_{\\rm CO}$ gradient and a superlinear $L'_{\\rm CO}$ vs. $L'_{\\rm [CI]}$ relation (slope = 1.54 $\\pm$ 0.02) at this spatial scale, which can be explained by radial excitation and/or line opacity gradients. Based on the molecular gas masses converted from the dust continuum emission, we found that the CO-to-H$_2$ and [CI]-to-H$_2$ conversion factors are relatively flat across the molecular gas disk with a median value of 3.5$^{+1.9}_{-1.3}$ and 20.7$^{+9.2}_{-4.9}$ $M_{\\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$, respectively. A non-LTE calculation yields that typical molecular gas properties seen in nearby (U)LIRGs ($n_{\\rm H_2}$ = 10$^{3-4}$ cm$^{-3}$, $T_{\\rm kin}$ $\\sim$ 50 K, and $X_{\\rm CI}$ = (0.8-2.3) $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$) can naturally reproduce the derived [CI]-to-H$_2$ conversion factor. However, we caution that a careful treatment of the physical gas properties is required in order to measure H$_2$ gas mass distributions in galaxies using a single [CI] line. Otherwise, a single [CI] line is not a good molecular gas estimator in a spatially resolved manner.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We use the extensive $Gaia$ Data Release 2 set of Long Period Variables to select a sample of Oxygen-rich Miras throughout the Milky Way disk and bulge for study. Exploiting the relation between Mira pulsation period and stellar age/chemistry, we slice the stellar density of the Galactic disk and bulge as a function of period. We find the morphology of both components evolves as a function of stellar age/chemistry with the stellar disk being stubby at old ages, becoming progressively thinner and more radially extended at younger stellar ages, consistent with the picture of inside-out and upside-down formation of the Milky Way's disk. We see evidence of a perturbed disk, with large-scale stellar over-densities visible both in and away from the stellar plane. We find the bulge is well modelled by a triaxial boxy distribution with an axis ratio of $\\sim [1:0.4:0.3]$. The oldest of the Miras ($\\sim$ 9-10 Gyr) show little bar-like morphology, whilst the younger stars appear inclined at a viewing angle of $\\sim 21^{\\circ}$ to the Sun-Galactic Centre line. This suggests that bar formation and buckling took place 8-9 Gyr ago, with the older Miras being hot enough to avoid being trapped by the growing bar. We find the youngest Miras to exhibit a strong peanut morphology, bearing the characteristic X-shape of an inclined bar structure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "This work is a continuation of Paper I [Sharykin et al., 2018] devoted to analysis of nonthermal electron dynamics and plasma heating in the confined M1.2 class solar flare SOL2015-03-15T22:43 revealing energy release in the highly sheared interacting magnetic loops in the low corona, above the polarity inversion line (PIL). The scope of the present work is to make the first extensive quantitative analysis of the photospheric magnetic field and photospheric vertical electric current (PVEC) dynamics in the confined flare region near the PIL using new vector magnetograms obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) with high temporal resolution of 135 s. Data analysis revealed sharp changes of the magnetic structure and PVEC associated with the flare onset near the PIL. It was found that the strongest plasma heating and electron acceleration were associated with the largest increase of the magnetic reconnection rate, total PVEC and effective PVEC density in the flare ribbons. Observations and non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations showed that the magnetic field structure around the PIL is consistent with the tether-cutting magnetic reconnection (TCMR) geometry. We gave qualitative interpretation of the observed dynamics of the flare ribbons, magnetic field and PVEC, and electron acceleration, within the TCMR scenario.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

To do so we enable a fluid description in a Lagrangian-coordinates approach, and prove the convergence of the Taylor-series representation of the Lagrangian displacement field until the time of collapse (\"shell-crossing\"). This allows the determination of the time for quasi-spherical collapse, which is shown to happen generically earlier than in the spherical case.

      "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are among the brightest transients in the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray sky. These flares are set into motion when a star is torn apart by the tidal field of a massive black hole, triggering a chain of events which is -- so far -- incompletely understood. However, the disruption process has been studied extensively for almost half a century, and unlike the later stages of a TDE, our understanding of the disruption itself is reasonably well converged. In this Chapter, we review both analytical and numerical models for stellar tidal disruption. Starting with relatively simple, order-of-magnitude physics, we review models of increasing sophistication, the semi-analytic ``affine formalism,'' hydrodynamic simulations of the disruption of polytropic stars, and the most recent hydrodynamic results concerning the disruption of realistic stellar models. Our review surveys the immediate aftermath of disruption in both typical and more unusual TDEs, exploring how the fate of the tidal debris changes if one considers non-main sequence stars, deeply penetrating tidal encounters, binary star systems, and sub-parabolic orbits. The stellar tidal disruption process provides the initial conditions needed to model the formation of accretion flows around quiescent massive black holes, and in some cases may also lead to directly observable emission, for example via shock breakout, gravitational waves or runaway nuclear fusion in deeply plunging TDEs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

This search for persistent TeV emission used a maximum-likelihood analysis assuming intrinsic power-law spectra attenuated by pair production of gamma-ray photons with the extragalactic background light. HAWC clearly detects persistent emission from Mkn~421 and Mkn~501, the two brightest blazars in the TeV sky, at 65$\\sigma$ and 17$\\sigma$ level, respectively. {Weaker evidence for long-term emission is found for three other known very-high energy emitters:} the radiogalaxy M87 and the BL Lac objects VER~J0521+211 and 1ES~1215+303, the later two at $z\\sim 0.1$. We find evidence for collective emission from the set of 30 previously reported very high-energy sources that excludes Mkn~421 and Mkn~501 with a random probability $\\sim 10^{-5}$.

In this paper we present new, sensitive high-resolution ($\\sim$30 mas) Band 7 ALMA observations of this source. This is the first source where we find counterparts in the sub-mm continuum to both scattered light spirals. The CO J=3-2 emission line also shows two spiral arms; in this case they can be traced over a more extended radial range, indicating that the southern spiral arm connects to the companion position. This is clear evidence that the companion is responsible for launching the spirals. The pitch angle of the sub-millimeter continuum spirals ($\\sim 6 ^{\\circ}$) is lower than the one in scattered light ($\\sim 16 ^{\\circ}$). We show that hydrodynamical simulations of binary-disc interaction can account for the difference in pitch angle only if one takes into account that the midplane is colder than the upper layers of the disc, as expected for the case of externally irradiated discs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP) is building a direct path to the Hubble constant (H0) using Population II stars as the calibrator of the SN Ia-based distance scale. This path to calibrate the SN Ia is independent of the systematics in the traditional Cepheid-based technique. In this paper, we present the distance to M101, the host to SN2011fe, using the I-band tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) based on observations from the ACS/WFC instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. The CCHP targets the halo of M101 where there is little to no host-galaxy dust, the red giant branch is isolated from nearly all other stellar populations, and there is virtually no source confusion or crowding at the magnitude of the tip. Applying the standard procedure for the TRGB method from the other works in the CCHP series, we find a foreground-extinction-corrected M101 distance modulus of {\\mu_0}=29.07+/-0.04(stat)+/-0.05(sys) mag, which corresponds to a distance of D=6.52+/-0.12(stat)+/-0.15(sys) Mpc. This result is consistent with several recent Cepheid-based determinations, suggesting agreement between Population I and II distance scales for this nearby SN Ia-host galaxy. We further analyze four archival datasets for M101 that have targeted its outer disk to argue that targeting in the stellar halo provides much more reliable distance measurements from the TRGB method due to the combination of multiple structural components and heavily population contamination. Application of the TRGB in complex regions will have sources of uncertainty not accounted for in commonly used uncertainty measurement techniques.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "In September 2017, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory recorded a very-high-energy neutrino in directional coincidence with a blazar in an unusually bright gamma-ray state, TXS0506+056. Blazars are prominent photon sources in the universe because they harbor a relativistic jet whose radiation is strongly collimated and amplified. High-energy atomic nuclei known as cosmic rays can produce neutrinos; thus the recent detection may help identifying the sources of the diffuse neutrino flux and the energetic cosmic rays. Here we report on a self-consistent analysis of the physical relation between the observed neutrino and the blazar, in particular the time evolution and spectral behavior of neutrino and photon emission. We demonstrate that a moderate enhancement in the number of cosmic rays during the flare can yield a very strong increase of the neutrino flux which is limited by co-produced hard X-rays and TeV gamma rays. We also test typical radiation models for compatibility and identify several model classes as incompatible with the observations. We investigate to what degree the findings can be generalized to the entire population of blazars, to determine the relation between their output in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, and suggest how to optimize the strategy of future observations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "To study the disc central surface brightness ($\\mu_0$) distribution in optical and near-infrared bands, we select 708 disc-dominated galaxies within a fixed distance of 57 Mpc from SDSS DR7 and UKIDSS DR10. Then we fit $\\mu_0$ distribution by using single and double Gaussian profiles with an optimal bin size for the final sample of 538 galaxies in optical $griz$ bands and near-infrared $YJHK$ bands.   Among the 8 bands, we find that $\\mu_{0}$ distribution in optical bands can not be much better fitted with double Gaussian profiles. However, for all the near-infrared bands, the evidence of being better fitted by using double Gaussian profiles is positive. Especially for $K$ band, the evidence of a double Gaussian profile being better than a single Gaussian profile for $\\mu_{0}$ distribution is very strong, the reliability of which can be approved by 1000 times test for our sample. No dust extinction correction is applied. The difference of $\\mu_{0}$ distribution between optical and near-infrared bands could be caused by the effect of dust extinction in optical bands. Due to the sample selection criteria, our sample is not absolutely complete. However, the sample incompleteness does not change the double Gaussian distribution of $\\mu_{0}$ in $K$ band. Furthermore, we discuss some possible reasons for the fitting results of $\\mu_{0}$ distribution in $K$ band. Conclusively, the double Gaussian distribution of $\\mu_{0}$ in $K$ band for our sample may depend on bulge-to-disk ratio, color and disk scalelength, rather than the inclination of sample galaxies, bin size and statistical fluctuations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Diffuse, non-thermal emission in galaxy clusters is increasingly being detected in low-frequency radio surveys and images. We present a new diffuse, steep-spectrum, non-thermal radio source within the cluster Abell 1127 found in survey data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). We perform follow-up observations with the 'extended' configuration MWA Phase II with improved resolution to better resolve the source and measure its low-frequency spectral properties. We use archival Very Large Array S-band data to remove the discrete source contribution from the MWA data, and from a power law model fit we find a spectral index of $-1.83\\pm0.29$ broadly consistent with relic-type sources. The source is revealed by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 150 MHz to have an elongated morphology, with a projected linear size of 850 kpc as measured in the MWA data. Using Chandra observations we derive morphological estimators and confirm quantitatively that the cluster is in a disturbed dynamical state, consistent with the majority of phoenices and relics being hosted by merging clusters. We discuss the implications of relying on morphology and low-resolution imaging alone for the classification of such sources and highlight the usefulness of the MHz to GHz radio spectrum in classifying these types of emission. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of using the MWA Phase II in conjunction with other instruments for detailed studies of diffuse, steep-spectrum, non-thermal radio emission within galaxy clusters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Hydrogen column densities inferred from X-ray absorption are typically 5 - 30 times larger than the neutral atomic hydrogen column densities derived from 21cm HI absorption toward radio-loud active galactic nuclei. Some part of the difference is ascribed to uncertainty in the spin temperature \\Tsp\\ = 100 K that is often used to convert 21cm HI HI absorption to N(HI). Here we propose another way to infer the gas column from HI absorption. In our Galaxy there is a nearly linear correlation between the inteferometrically-measured integrated 21cm HI absorption \\WHI\\ and reddening, \\WHI\\ $\\propto$ \\EBV$^{1.10}$ for \\WHI\\ $\\ga 0.7$ \\kms\\ or \\EBV\\ $\\ga 0.04$ mag. Scaling \\EBV\\ then provides the total gas column density N(H) from the same dust column that is responsible for optical obscuration and X-ray absorption, without calculating N(HI). Values of N(H) so derived typically exceed N(HI) by a factor 4 because the ubiquitous Galactic 21cm HI HI absorption samples only a portion of the interstellar gas. If the well-studied case of Hydra-A is a guide, even very large disparities in X-ray and 21cm HI gas column densities can be explained by resolving the core radiocontinuum and inferring N(H) from 21cm HI absorption. Milky Way conditions are often invoked in discussion of obscured AGN, so the empirical relationship seen in the Milky Way should be a relevant benchmark.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "AGN-driven outflows are considered as one of the processes driving the co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies. We present integral field spectroscopy of six Type 2 AGNs at z < 0.1, which are selected as AGNs without strong outflows based on the kinematics of [Oiii] gas. Using spatially resolved data, we investigate the ionized gas kinematics and photoionization properties in comparison with AGNs with strong outflows. We find significant differences between the kinematics of ionized gas and stars for two AGNs, which indicates the presence of AGN-driven outflows. Nevertheless, the low velocity and velocity dispersion of ionized gas indicate relatively weak outflows in these AGNs. Our results highlight the importance of spatially-resolved observation in investigating gas kinematics and identifying the signatures of AGN-driven outflows. While it is unclear what determines the occurrence of outflows, we discuss the conditions and detectability of AGN-driven outflows based on a larger sample of AGNs with and without outflows, suggesting the importance of gas content in the host galaxies.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We reanalyse the LIGO-Virgo strain data of the 10 binary black hole mergers reported to date and compute the likelihood function in terms of chirp mass, mass ratio and effective spin. We discuss the strong degeneracy between mass ratio and spin for the three lighter events. We use this likelihood and an estimate of the horizon volume as a function of intrinsic parameters to constrain the properties of the population of merging binary black holes. The data disfavour large spins. Typical spins are constrained to $\\overline a \\lesssim 0.4$, even if the underlying population has randomly-oriented spins. For aligned spins the constraints are tighter, with typical spins required to be around $\\overline a\\sim 0.1$ and have comparable dispersion. We detect no statistically significant tendency towards a positive average spin in the direction of the orbital angular momentum. We put an upper limit on the fraction of systems where the secondary could have been tidally locked prior to the formation of the black holes (corresponding to merger times shorter than $10^8$ years) $f \\lesssim 0.3$. Four events are consistent with having a maximally-spinning secondary, although one only marginally. We confirm previous findings that there is a hint of a cutoff at high mass.

      "We analyze new XMM-Newton and archival Chandra observations of the middle-aged $\\gamma$-ray radio-quiet pulsar J1957+5033. We detect, for the first time, X-ray pulsations with the pulsar spin period of the point-like source coinciding by position with the pulsar. This confirms the pulsar nature of the source. In the 0.15--0.5 keV band, there is a single pulse per period and the pulsed fraction is $\\approx18\\pm6$ per cent. In this band, the pulsar spectrum is dominated by a thermal emission component that likely comes from the entire surface of the neutron star, while at higher energies ($\\gtrsim0.7$ keV) it is described by a power law with the photon index $\\Gamma \\approx 1.6$. We construct new hydrogen atmosphere models for neutron stars with dipole magnetic fields and non-uniform surface temperature distributions with relatively low effective temperatures. We use them in the spectral analysis and derive the pulsar average effective temperature of $\\approx(2-3)\\times10^5$ K. This makes J1957+5033 the coldest among all known thermally emitting neutron stars with ages below 1 Myr. Using the interstellar extinction--distance relation, we constrain the distance to the pulsar in the range of 0.1--1 kpc. We compare the obtained X-ray thermal luminosity with those for other neutron stars and various neutron star cooling models and set some constraints on latter. We observe a faint trail-like feature, elongated $\\sim 8$ arcmin from J1957+5033. Its spectrum can be described by a power law with a photon index $\\Gamma=1.9\\pm0.5$ suggesting that it is likely a pulsar wind nebula powered by J1957+5033.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

The parity violation in the weak interaction has direct consequences on the transport of polarization in cosmic ray showers. In this paper, we show that muons retain their polarization down to energies at which they can initiate enantioselective mutagenesis. Therefore, muons are most likely to succeed in establishing the connection between broken symmetries in the standard model of particle physics and that found in living organisms. We calculate the radiation doses deposited by primary and secondary cosmic rays at various prime targets for the searches of life in the solar system: Mars, Venus, Titan, icy moons and planetesimals, and discuss the implications for the enantioselective mutagenesis proposed as to be the driver of homochiralization.

      "The lunar South pole likely contains significant amounts of water in the permanently shadowed craters there. Extracting this water for life support at a lunar base or to make rocket fuel would take large amounts of power, of order Gigawatts. A natural place to obtain this power are the \"Peaks of Eternal Light\", that lie a few kilometers away on the crater rims and ridges above the permanently shadowed craters. The amount of solar power that could be captured depends on how tall a tower can be built to support the photovoltaic panels. The low gravity, lack of atmosphere, and quiet seismic environment of the Moon suggests that towers could be built much taller than on Earth. Here we look at the limits to building tall concrete towers on the Moon. We choose concrete as the capital cost of transporting large masses of iron or carbon fiber to the Moon is presently so expensive that profitable operation of a power plant is unlikely. Concrete instead can be manufactured in situ from the lunar regolith. We find that, with minimum wall thicknesses (20 cm), towers up to several kilometers tall are stable. The mass of concrete needed, however, grows rapidly with height, from $\\sim$ 760 mt at 1 km to $\\sim$ 4,100 mt at 2 km to $\\sim 10^5$ mt at 7 km and $\\sim 10^6$ mt at 17 km.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The latest SDSS/APOGEE data release DR14 has provided an increased number of stellar spectra in the H band and associated stellar models using an innovative algorithm known as The Cannon. We took advantage of these novelties to extract the 15 273 {\\AA} near-infrared DIB and to study its link with dust extinction and emission. We modified our automated fitting methods dedicated to hot stars and used in earlier studies with some adaptations motivated by the change from early- or intermediate-type stars to red giants. A new method has also been developed to quantify the upper limits on DIB strengths. We compared our DIB measurements with the stellar extinctions Av from the Starhorse database. We then compared the resulting DIB-extinction ratio with the dust optical depth derived from Planck data, globally and also separately for nearby off-Plane cloud complexes. Our analysis has led to the production of a catalog containing 124 064 new measurements of the 15 273 {\\AA} DIB, allowing us to revisit the correlation between DIB strength and dust reddening. The new data reveal clearly that the sky-averaged 15 273 {\\AA} DIB strength is linearly correlated with Av over two orders as reported by earlier studies but leveling-off with respect to extinction for highly reddened lines-of-sight behind dense clouds. The comparison with Planck individual optical depths reveals in a conspicuous way this DIB depletion in the dense cores and shows it applies to all off-Plane dense clouds. APOGEE measurements confirm the ubiquity of the 15 273 {\\AA} DIB carrier decrease with respect to dust grains in dense cloud cores, in a manner that can be empirically related to the dust optical depth reached in the cloud.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We revisit the theory of stochastic heating of ions and investigate its phase-space signatures in kinetic turbulence of relevance to low-$\\beta$ portions of the solar wind. We retain a full scale-dependent approach in our treatment, and consider the case in which electric-field fluctuations can be described by a generalized Ohm's law that includes Hall and thermo-electric effects. These two electric-field terms provide the dominant contributions to stochastic ion heating when the ion-Larmor scale is much smaller than the ion skin depth, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{i}}\\ll d_{\\mathrm{i}}$, which is the case at $\\beta{\\ll}1$. Employing well-known spectral scaling laws for Alfv\\'en-wave and kinetic-Alfv\\'en-wave turbulent fluctuations, we obtain scaling relations characterizing the field-perpendicular particle-energization rate and energy diffusion coefficient associated with stochastic heating in these two regimes. Phase-space signatures of ion heating are then investigated using 3D hybrid-kinetic simulations of continuously driven Alfv\\'enic turbulence at low $\\beta$. In these simulations, energization of ions parallel to the magnetic field is sub-dominant compared to its perpendicular counterpart ($Q_{\\parallel,\\mathrm{i}}\\ll Q_{\\perp,\\mathrm{i}}$), and the fraction of turbulent energy that goes into ion heating is ${\\approx}75$\\% at $\\beta_{\\mathrm{i}}=0.3$ and ${\\approx}40$\\% at $\\beta_{\\mathrm{i}}{\\simeq}0.1$. The phase-space signatures of ion energization are consistent with Landau-resonant collisionless damping and a ($\\beta$-dependent) combination of ion-cyclotron and stochastic heating. We demonstrate good agreement between our theory and various signatures associated with the stochastic portion of the heating. We discuss the effect of intermittency on stochastic heating and the implications of our work for the interpretation of stochastic heating in solar-wind spacecraft data.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Magnetic flux generated within the solar interior emerges to the surface, forming active regions (ARs) and sunspots. Flux emergence may trigger explosive events, such as flares and coronal mass ejections and therefore understanding emergence is useful for space-weather forecasting. Evidence of any pre-emergence signatures will also shed light on sub-surface processes responsible for emergence. In this paper, we present a first analysis of emerging ARs from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic Emerging Active Regions (SDO/HEAR) dataset (Schunker et al. 2016) using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to characterize pre-emergence surface magnetic-field properties. The trained CNN classifies between pre-emergence (PE) line-of-sight magnetograms and a control set of non-emergence (NE) magnetograms with a True Skill Statistic (TSS) score of ~85%, 3h prior to emergence and ~40\\%, 24h prior to emergence. Our results are better than a baseline classification TSS obtained using discriminant analysis of only the unsigned magnetic flux. We develop a network pruning algorithm to interpret the trained CNN and show that the CNN incorporates filters that respond positively as well as negatively to the unsigned magnetic flux of the magnetograms. Using synthetic magnetograms, we demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the length-scale of the magnetic regions with small-scale and intense fields producing maximum CNN output and possibly a characteristic pre-emergence pattern. Given increasing popularity of deep learning, techniques developed here for interpretation of the trained CNN -- using network pruning and synthetic data -- are relevant for future applications in solar and astrophysical data analysis.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "With the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) we monitored the black hole candidate X-ray binary MAXI J1535--571 over seven epochs from 21 September to 2 October 2017. Using ASKAP observations, we studied the HI absorption spectrum from gas clouds along the line-of-sight and thereby constrained the distance to the source. The maximum negative radial velocities measured from the HI absorption spectra for MAXI J1535--571 and an extragalactic source in the same field of view are $-69\\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-89\\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. This rules out the far kinematic distance ($9.3^{+0.5}_{-0.6}$ kpc), giving a most likely distance of $4.1^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ kpc, with a strong upper limit of the tangent point at $6.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ kpc. At our preferred distance, the peak unabsorbed luminosity of MAXI J1535--571 was $>78$ per cent of the Eddington luminosity, and shows that the soft-to-hard spectral state transition occurred at the very low luminosity of 1.2 -- 3.4 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ times the Eddington luminosity. Finally, this study highlights the capabilities of new wide-field radio telescopes to probe Galactic transient outbursts, by allowing us to observe both a target source and a background comparison source in a single telescope pointing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The first detection of gravitational waves from a neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) merger, GW170817, and the increasing number of observations of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) have greatly motivated studies of the origins of NS-NS and neutron star - black hole (NS-BH) binaries. We calculate the merger rates of NS-NS and NS-BH binaries from globular clusters (GCs) using realistic GC simulations with the \\texttt{CMC} cluster catalog. We use a large sample of models with a range of initial numbers of stars, metallicities, virial radii and galactocentric distances, representative of the present-day Milky Way GCs, to quantify the inspiral times and volumetric merger rates as a function of redshift, both inside and ejected from clusters. We find that over the complete lifetime of most GCs, stellar BHs dominate the cluster cores and prevent the mass segregation of NSs, thereby reducing the dynamical interaction rates of NSs so that at most a few NS binary mergers are ever produced. We estimate the merger rate in the local universe to be $\\sim\\rm{0.02\\,Gpc^{-3}\\,yr^{-1}}$ for both NS-NS and NS-BH binaries, or a total of $\\sim 0.04$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ for both populations. These rates are about 5 orders of magnitude below the current empirical merger rate from LIGO/Virgo. We conclude that dynamical interactions in GCs do not play a significant role in enhancing the NS-NS and NS-BH merger rates.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "As a result of the slow action of two-body encounters, globular clusters develop mass segregation and attain a condition of only partial energy equipartition even in their central, most relaxed regions. Realistic numerical simulations show that, during the process, a radially-biased anisotropy profile slowly builds up, mimicking that resulting from incomplete violent relaxation. Commonly used dynamical models, such as the one-component King models, cannot describe these properties.

      "In 2015 and 2017, the AM CVn candidate NSV 1440 showed superoutbursts having the characteristic features of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae (DNe). By analogy with hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables (CVs), we can interpret these outbursts as `double superoutbursts' which are composed of the first superoutburst with early superhumps and the second superoutburst with ordinary superhumps. The object also showed multiple rebrightenings after the main superoutbursts. Early superhumps had been never observed in AM CVn stars and candidates, thus NSV 1440 is the first confirmed WZ Sge-type AM CVn candidate. We obtained the early superhump period of 0.0252329(49) d and the growing (stage A) superhumps period of 0.025679(20) d from the 2015 superoutburst. We regarded the early superhump period as the orbital one. By using these periods we estimated the mass ratio $q = $0.045(2). This value suggests that NSV 1440 is indeed an AM CVn star and that the secondary is a semi-degenerate star.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We present new, high spatial and spectral resolution observations of the complex at near-infrared wavelengths ($2.0-2.3$ $\\mu$m) using the LUCI near-infrared camera and spectrograph with the Advanced Rayleigh guided Ground layer adaptive Optics System, ARGOS, at the Large Binocular Telescope. We discover a string of tightly collimated knots of H$_2$ emission, spanning the full observed field of $\\sim4^\\prime$, and determine an excitation temperature of $2600\\pm500$ K for the brightest knot, which is situated close to the driving source. We show that the kinematics of the knots are consistent with them being ejected from the central source on timescales of a few times $10^{2-3}$ years. The driving source (or sources) of the outflow is obscured at near-infrared wavelengths, possibly due to a thick accretion disk. The distribution of H$_2$ emission in the region, together with high mass-infall rates reported recently, indicate G192 has undergone several large accretion bursts in the recent past.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Understanding the geometry and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is important to estimate black hole masses in AGN and study the accretion process. The technique of reverberation mapping (RM) has provided estimates of BLR size for more than 100 AGN now, however, the structure of the BLR has been studied for only a handful number of objects. Towards this, we investigated the geometry of the BLR for a large sample of 57 AGN using archival RM data. We performed systematic modeling of the continuum and emission line light curves using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on Bayesian statistics implemented in PBMAP (Parallel Bayesian code for reverberation-MAPping data) code to constrain BLR geometrical parameters and recover velocity integrated transfer function. We found that the recovered transfer functions have various shapes such as single-peaked, double-peaked and top-hat suggesting that AGN have very different BLR geometries. Our model lags are in general consistent with that estimated using the conventional cross-correlation methods. The BLR sizes obtained from our modeling approach is related to the luminosity with a slope of 0.583 (+/-) 0.026 and 0.471 (+/-) 0.084 based on H{\\beta} and H{\\alpha} lines, respectively. We found a non-linear response of emission line fluxes to the ionizing optical continuum for 93\\% objects. The estimated virial factors for the AGN studied in this work range from 0.79 to 4.94 having a mean at 1.78 (+/-) 1.77 consistent with the values found in the literature.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We investigated the chromospheric activity of 60 pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in four molecular clouds and five moving groups. It is considered that strong chromospheric activity is driven by the dynamo processes generated by the stellar rotation. In contrast, several researchers have pointed out that the chromospheres of PMS stars are activated by mass accretion from their protoplanetary disks. In this study, the Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) emission lines were investigated utilizing medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy. The observations were conducted with Nayuta/MALLS and Subaru/HDS. Additionally, archive data obtained by Keck/HIRES, VLT/UVES, and VLT/X-Shooter was used. The small ratios of the equivalent widths indicate that Ca II IRT emission lines arise primarily in dense chromospheric regions. Seven PMS stars show broad emission lines. Among them, four PMS stars have more than one order of magnitude brighter emission line fluxes compared to the low-mass stars in young open clusters. The four PMS stars have a high mass accretion rate, which indicates that the broad and strong emission results from a large mass accretion. However, most PMS stars exhibit narrow emission lines. No significant correlation was found between the accretion rate and flux of the emission line. The ratios of the surface flux of the Ca II IRT lines to the stellar bolometric luminosity, R'_IRT, of the PMS stars with narrow emission lines are as large as the largest R'_IRT of the low-mass stars in the young open clusters. This result indicates that most PMS stars, even in the classical T Tauri star stage, have chromospheric activity similar to zero-age main-sequence stars.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Here we describe the algorithm, discuss its performance and illustrate some of its many applications.

      "Synchrotron radio emission from non-relativistic jets powered by massive protostars has been reported, indicating the presence of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields of strength ~0.3-5 mG. We study diffusive shock acceleration and magnetic field amplification in protostellar jets with speeds between 300 and 1500 km/s. We show that the magnetic field in the synchrotron emitter can be amplified by the non-resonant hybrid (Bell) instability excited by the cosmic-ray streaming. By combining the synchrotron data with basic theory of Bell instability we estimate the magnetic field in the synchrotron emitter and the maximum energy of protons. Protons can achieve maximum energies in the range 0.04-0.65 TeV and emit gamma rays in their interaction with matter fields. We predict detectable levels of gamma rays in IRAS 16547-5247 and IRAS 16848-4603. The gamma ray flux can be significantly enhanced by the gas mixing due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The detection of this radiation by the Fermi satellite in the GeV domain and the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array at higher energies may open a new window to study the formation of massive stars, as well as diffusive acceleration and magnetic field amplification in shocks with velocities of about 1000 km/s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The large number of new planets expected from wide-area transit surveys means that follow-up transmission spectroscopy studies of their atmospheres will be limited by the availability of telescope assets. We argue that telescopes covering a broad range of apertures will be required, with even 1m-class instruments providing a potentially important contribution. Survey strategies that employ automated target selection will enable robust population studies. As part of such a strategy, we propose a decision metric to pair the best target to the most suitable telescope, and demonstrate its effectiveness even when only primary transit observables are available. Transmission spectroscopy target selection need not therefore be impeded by the bottle-neck of requiring prior follow-up observations to determine the planet mass. The decision metric can be easily deployed within a distributed heterogeneous network of telescopes equipped to undertake either broadband photometry or spectroscopy. We show how the metric can be used either to optimise the observing strategy for a given telescope (e.g. choice of filter) or to enable the selection of the best telescope to optimise the overall sample size. Our decision metric can also provide the basis for a selection function to help evaluate the statistical completeness of follow-up transmission spectroscopy datasets. Finally, we validate our metric by comparing its ranked set of targets against lists of planets that have had their atmospheres successfully probed, and against some existing prioritised exoplanet lists.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Do void statistics contain information beyond the tracer 2-point correlation function? Yes! As we vary the sum of the neutrino masses, we find void statistics contain information absent when using just tracer 2-point statistics. Massive neutrinos uniquely affect cosmic voids. We explore their impact on void clustering using both the DEMNUni and MassiveNuS simulations. For voids, neutrino effects depend on the observed void tracers. As the neutrino mass increases, the number of small voids traced by cold dark matter particles increases and the number of large voids decreases. Surprisingly, when massive, highly biased, halos are used as tracers, we find the opposite effect. The scale at which voids cluster, as well as the void correlation, is similarly sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses and the tracers. This scale dependent trend is not due to simulation volume or halo density. The interplay of these signatures in the void abundance and clustering leaves a distinct fingerprint that could be detected with observations and potentially help break degeneracies between different cosmological parameters.

      "The Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on board the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed a CME on 2018 November 01, the first day of the initial PSP encounter. The speed of the CME, approximately 200-300 km s$^{-1}$ in the WISPR field of view, is typical of slow, streamer blowout CMEs. This event was also observed by the LASCO coronagraphs. WISPR and LASCO view remarkably similar structures that enable useful cross-comparison between the two data sets as well as stereoscopic imaging of the CME. Analysis is extended to lower heights by linking the white-light observations to EUV data from AIA, which reveal a structure that erupts more than a full day earlier before the CME finally gathers enough velocity to propagate outward. This EUV feature appears as a brightness enhancement in cooler temperatures such as 171 \\AA, but as a cavity in nominal coronal temperatures such as 193 \\AA. By comparing this circular, dark feature in 193 \\AA \\ to the dark, white-light cavity at the center of the eruption in WISPR and LASCO, it can be seen that this is one coherent structure that exists prior to the eruption in the low corona before entering the heliosphere and likely corresponds to the core of the magnetic flux rope. It is also believed that the relative weakness of the event contributed to the clarity of the flux rope in WISPR, as the CME did not experience impulsive forces or strong interaction with external structures that can lead to more complex structural evolution.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Ultra-light axions (ULAs) with mass less than 10^-20 eV have interesting behaviors that may contribute to either dark energy or dark matter at different epochs of the Universe. Its properties can be explored by cosmological observations, such as expansion history of the Universe, cosmic large-scale structure, cosmic microwave background, etc. In this work, we study the ULAs with a mass around 10^-33 eV, which means the ULA field still rolls slowly at present with the equation of state w=-1 as dark energy. In order to investigate the mass and other properties of this kind of ULA field, we adopt the measurements of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and Hubble parameter H(z). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is employed to perform the constraints on the parameters. Finally, by exploring four cases of the model, we find that the mass of this ULA field is about 3x10^-33 eV if assuming the initial axion field phi_i=M_pl. We also investigate a general case by assuming phi_i< M_pl and find that the fitting results of phi_i/M_pl are consistent with or close to 1 for the datasets we use.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The hypothesis that strange quark matter is the true ground state of matter has been investigated for almost four decades, but only a few works have explored the dynamics of binary systems of quark stars. This is partly due to the numerical challenges that need to be faced when modelling the large discontinuities at the surface of these stars. We here present a novel technique in which the EOS of a quark star is suitably rescaled to produce a smooth change of the specific enthalpy across a very thin crust. The introduction of the crust has been carefully tested by considering the oscillation properties of isolated quark stars, showing that the response of the simulated quark stars matches accurately the perturbative predictions. Using this technique, we have carried out the first fully general-relativistic simulations of the merger of quark-star binaries finding several important differences between quark-star binaries and hadronic-star binaries with the same mass and comparable tidal deformability. In particular, we find that dynamical mass loss is significantly suppressed in quark-star binaries. In addition, quark-star binaries have merger and post-merger frequencies that obey the same quasi-universal relations derived from hadron stars if expressed in terms of the tidal deformability, but not when expressed in terms of the average stellar compactness. Hence, it may be difficult to distinguish the two classes of stars if no information on the stellar radius is available. Finally, differences are found in the distributions in velocity and entropy of the ejected matter, for which quark-stars have much smaller tails. Whether these differences in the ejected matter will leave an imprint in the electromagnetic counterpart and nucleosynthetic yields remains unclear, calling for the construction of an accurate model for the evaporation of the ejected quarks into nucleons.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Pulsating thermal X-ray emission from millisecond pulsars can be used to obtain constraints on the neutron star equation of state, but to date only five such sources have been identified. Of these five millisecond pulsars, only two have well constrained neutron star masses, which improve the determination of the radius via modelling of the X-ray waveform. We aim to find other millisecond pulsars that already have well constrained mass and distance measurements that show pulsed thermal X-ray emission in order to obtain tight constraints on the neutron star equation of state. The millisecond pulsar PSR~J1909--3744 has an accurately determined mass, M = 1.54$\\pm$0.03 M$_\\odot$ (1 $\\sigma$ error) and distance, D = 1.07$\\pm$0.04 kpc. We analysed {\\em XMM-Newton} data of this 2.95 ms pulsar to identify the nature of the X-ray emission. We show that the X-ray emission from PSR~J1909--3744 appears to be dominated by thermal emission from the polar cap. Only a single component model is required to fit the data. The black-body temperature of this emission is kT=0.26\\ud{0.03}{0.02} keV and we find a 0.2--10 keV un-absorbed flux of 1.1 $\\times$ 10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ or an un-absorbed luminosity of 1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Thanks to the previously determined mass and distance constraints of the neutron star PSR~J1909--3744, and its predominantly thermal emission, deep observations of this object with future X-ray facilities should provide useful constraints on the neutron star equation of state.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Surveys of the Milky Way (MW) and M31 enable detailed studies of stellar populations across ages and metallicities, with the goal of reconstructing formation histories across cosmic time. These surveys motivate key questions for galactic archaeology in a cosmological context: when did the main progenitor of a MW/M31-mass galaxy form, and what were the galactic building blocks that formed it? We investigate the formation times and progenitor galaxies of MW/M31-mass galaxies using the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations, including 6 isolated MW/M31-mass galaxies and 6 galaxies in Local Group (LG)-like pairs at z = 0. We examine main progenitor \"formation\" based on two metrics: (1) transition from primarily ex-situ to in-situ stellar mass growth and (2) mass dominance compared to other progenitors. We find that the main progenitor of a MW/M31-mass galaxy emerged typically at z ~ 3-4 (11.6-12.2 Gyr ago), while stars in the bulge region (inner 2 kpc) at z = 0 formed primarily in a single main progenitor at z < 5 (< 12.6 Gyr ago). Compared with isolated hosts, the main progenitors of LG-like paired hosts emerged significantly earlier (\\Delta z ~ 2, \\Delta t ~ 1.6 Gyr), with ~ 4x higher stellar mass at all z > 4 (> 12.2 Gyr ago). This highlights the importance of environment in MW/M31-mass galaxy formation, especially at early times. Overall, about 100 galaxies with M_star > 10^5 M_sun formed a typical MW/M31-mass system. Thus, surviving satellites represent a highly incomplete census (by ~ 5x) of the progenitor population.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Mars shares many similarities and characteristics to Earth including various geological features and planetary structure. The remarkable bimodal distribution of elevations in both planets is one of the most striking global features suggesting similar geodynamic processes of crustal differentiation on Earth and Mars. There also exist several evidences, based on geographic features resembling ancient shorelines, for existence of an ancient martian ocean in the northern hemisphere which covers nearly one third of the planet's surface. However, the interpretation of some features as ancient shorelines has been thoroughly challenged that left the existence of a primordial martian ocean controversial. Moreover, if oceans were formerly present on Mars, there is still a big ambiguity about the volume of water with the estimations ranging over $4$ orders of magnitude. Here we map the martian sea level problem onto a percolation model that provides strong evidence that the longest iso-height line on Mars that separates the northern and southern hemispheres, acts as a critical level height with divergent correlation length and plays the same role as the present mean sea level does on Earth. Our results unravel remarkable similarities between Mars and Earth, posing a testable hypothesis about the level of the ancient ocean on Mars that can be answered experimentally by the future investigations and spacecraft exploration.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

The modulation has high significance (chance probability $p\\approx 10^{-7}$), is approximately sinusoidal, peaks near pulsar superior conjunction, and is detected only in the low-energy 100-600 MeV band. The modulation is confined to the on-pulse interval, suggesting that the variation is in the 2.9-ms pulsed signal itself. This contrasts with the few other known systems exhibiting GeV orbital modulations, as these are unpulsed and generally associated with beamed emission from an intrabinary shock. The origin of the modulated pulsed signal is not yet clear, although we describe several scenarios, including Compton upscattering of photons from the heated companion. This would require high coherence in the striped pulsar wind.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We use an analytical approach to study ram pressure stripping with simple models for discs and halo gas distribution to study the phenomena in cluster, group and galaxy halos. We also study variations with galaxy properties and redshift. In each case we model the worst case scenario (i.e., maximum effect due to ram pressure). We show that there is little variation in the worst case scenario with redshift. We find that gas discs in galaxies with a higher spin parameter get stripped sooner than galaxies with a smaller spin parameter. Galaxies in cluster halos get stripped of gas more effciently as compared to group and galaxy halos: this is due to the higher infall speed and a higher density of gas in the ICM due to a greater retention of baryons. We comment on the limitations of our model and situations where a signiffcant amount of gas may be retained in galaxy disc and also give an illustration for the same. Lastly, we discuss implications for star formation in galaxies as these fall into halos.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "High-energy radiation caused by exoplanetary space weather events from planet-hosting stars can play a crucial role in conditions promoting or destroying habitability in addition to the conventional factors. In this paper, we present the first quantitative impact evaluation system of stellar flares on the habitability factors with an emphasis on the impact of Stellar Proton Events. We derive the maximum flare energy from stellar starspot sizes and examine the impacts of flare associated ionizing radiation on CO$_2$, H$_2$, N$_2$+O$_2$ --rich atmospheres of a number of well-characterized terrestrial type exoplanets. Our simulations based on the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System [PHITS] suggest that the estimated ground level dose for each planet in the case of terrestrial-level atmospheric pressure (1 bar) for each exoplanet does not exceed the critical dose for complex (multi-cellular) life to persist, even for the planetary surface of Proxima Centauri b, Ross-128 b and TRAPPIST-1 e. However, when we take into account the effects of the possible maximum flares from those host stars, the estimated dose reaches fatal levels at the terrestrial lowest atmospheric depth on TRAPPIST-1 e and Ross-128 b. Large fluxes of coronal XUV radiation from active stars induces high atmospheric escape rates from close-in exoplanets suggesting that the atmospheric depth can be substantially smaller than that on the Earth. In a scenario with the atmospheric thickness of 1/10 of Earth's, the radiation dose from close-in planets including Proxima Centauri b and TRAPPIST-1 e reach near fatal dose levels with annual frequency of flare occurrence from their hoststars.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Based on dust dynamics in circumbinary discs (Poblete, Cuello, and Cuadra 2019), we constrain the inclination of the binary with respect to the circumbinary disc to range between 60{\\deg} and 90{\\deg}. We predict that the stellar companion is located roughly 0.18 arcsec from the central star towards the east-southeast, above the plane of the disc. Should this companion be detected in the near future, our model indicates that it should be moving away from the primary star at a rate of 6 mas/yr on the plane of the sky.

      "In Wada, Tsukamoto, and Kokubo (2019), we proposed for the first time that a new class of planets, \"blanets\" (i.e., black hole planets), can be formed around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic center. Here, we investigate the dust coagulation processes and physical conditions of the blanet formation outside the snow line ($r_{snow} \\sim $ several parsecs) in more detail, especially considering the effect of the radial advection of the dust aggregates. We found that a dimensionless parameter $\\alpha = v_t^2/c_s^2$, where $v_t$ is the turbulent velocity and $c_s$ is the sound velocity, describing the turbulent viscosity should be smaller than 0.04 in the circumnuclear disk, to prevent the destruction of the aggregates due to collisions. The formation timescale of blanets $\\tau_{GI}$ at $r_{snow}$ is, $\\tau_{GI} \\simeq$ 70-80 Myr for $\\alpha = 0.01-0.04$ and $M_{BH} = 10^6 M_\\odot$. The mass of the blanets ranges from $\\sim 20 M_E$ to $3000 M_E$ in $r < 4$ pc for $\\alpha = 0.02$ ($M_E$ is the Earth mass), which is in contrast with $ 4 M_E-6 M_E$ for the case without the radial advection.

In this work, we investigate the locations of the outer boundaries of dark matter and gas around cluster-size dark matter haloes, by analyzing a sample of 65 massive dark matter halos extracted from the Omega500 zoom-in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We show that the location of accretion shock is offset from that of the dark matter splashback radius, contrary to the prediction of the self-similar models. The accretion shock radius is larger than all definitions of the splashback radius in the literature by 20-100%. The accretion shock radius defined using the steepest drop in the entropy pressure profiles is approximately 2 times larger than the splashback radius defined by the steepest slope in the dark matter density profile, and it is ~1.2 times larger than the edge of the dark matter phase-space structure.

      "Transport of angular momentum has been a challenging topic within the stellar evolution community, even more since the recent asteroseismic surveys. All published studies on rotation using asteroseismic observations show a discrepancy between the observed and calculated rotation rates, indicating there is an undetermined process of angular momentum transport active in these stars. We aim to constrain the efficiency of this process by investigating rotation rates of 2.5 M$_{\\odot}$ stars. First, we investigated whether the Tayler-Spruit dynamo could be responsible for the extra transport of angular momentum for stars with an initial mass of 2.5 M$_{\\odot}$. Then, by computing rotating models including a constant additional artificial viscosity, we determined the efficiency of the missing process of angular momentum transport by comparing the models to the asteroseismic observations of core helium burning stars. Parameter studies were performed to investigate the effect of the stellar evolution code used, initial mass, and evolutionary stage. We evolved our models into the white dwarf phase, and provide a comparison to white dwarf rotation rates. The Tayler-Spruit dynamo is unable to provide enough transport of angular momentum to reach the observed values of the core helium burning stars investigated in this paper. We find that a value for the additional artificial viscosity $\\nu_{\\rm{add}}$ around 10$^7$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ provides enough transport of angular momentum. However, the rotational period of these models is too high in the white dwarf phase to match the white dwarf observations. From this comparison we infer that the efficiency of the missing process must decrease during the core helium burning phase. When excluding the $\\nu_{\\rm{add}}$ during core helium burning phase, we can match the rotational periods of both the core helium burning stars and white dwarfs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We update predictions for observables in the \"delicate\" D3/anti-D3 inflationary model on the conifold. We use a full CMB likelihood calculation to assess goodness-of-fit, which is necessary because in this model the zeta power spectrum often cannot be modelled as a power-law over observable scales. For the first time we are able to provide accurate forecasts for the amplitude of three-point correlations. In a significant portion of its parameter space the model follows Maldacena's single-field prediction fNL ~ -(5/12)(ns-1) if nt << 1. Therefore |fNL| is usually small when the power spectrum satisfies observational constraints. In a small number of cases the bispectrum is instead dominated by effects from rapid switching between angular minima. The resulting amplitudes are larger, but mostly with unacceptable spectral behaviour. In the most extreme case we obtain |fNLeq| ~ 75 at kt/3 = 0.002/Mpc. It has been suggested that the quasi-single field inflation (\"QSFI\") mechanism could produce significant 3-point correlations in this model. We do observe rare shifts in amplitude between equilateral and squeezed configurations that could possibly be associated with QSFI effects, but more investigation is needed to establish the full bispectrum shape. There is evidence of \"shape\" running between equilateral and squeezed configurations that may be inherited from the scale dependence of the spectrum. We explore the dependence of observables on discrete choices such as the truncation point of the potential. Our analysis illustrates the advantages of a standard format for information exchange within the inflationary model-building and testing community.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "This brief review will discuss the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the nitrogen atmospheres of the icy bodies in the solar system, particularly of Titan, Triton and Pluto. An important tool to analyse and understand the origin and evolution of these atmospheres can be found in the different isotopic signatures of their atmospheric constituents. The $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of the N$_2$-dominated atmospheres of these bodies serve as a footprint of the building blocks from which Titan, Triton and Pluto originated and of the diverse fractionation processes that shaped these atmospheres over their entire evolution. Together with other measured isotopic and elemental ratios such as $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C or Ar/N these atmospheres can give important insights into the history of the icy bodies in the solar system, the diverse processes that affect their N$_2$-dominated atmospheres, and the therewith connected solar activity evolution. Titan's gaseous envelope most likely originated from ammonia ices with possible contributions from refractory organics. Its isotopic signatures can yet be seen in the - compared to Earth - comparatively heavy $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of 167.7, even though this value slightly evolved over its history due to atmospheric escape and photodissociation of N$_2$. The origin and evolution of Pluto's and Triton's tenuous nitrogen atmospheres remain unclear, even though it might be likely that their atmospheres originated from the protosolar nebula or from comets. An in-situ space mission to Triton such as the recently proposed Trident mission, and/or to the ice giants would be a crucial cornerstone for a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the icy bodies in the outer solar system and their atmospheres in general.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Precision measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization require extreme control of instrumental systematics. In a companion paper we have presented cosmological constraints from observations with the BICEP2 and Keck Array experiments up to and including the 2015 observing season (BK15), resulting in the deepest CMB polarization maps to date and a statistical sensitivity to the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $\\sigma(r) = 0.020$. In this work we characterize the beams and constrain potential systematic contamination from main beam shape mismatch at the three BK15 frequencies (95, 150, and 220 GHz). Far-field maps of 7,360 distinct beam patterns taken from 2010-2015 are used to measure differential beam parameters and predict the contribution of temperature-to-polarization leakage to the BK15 B-mode maps. In the multifrequency, multicomponent likelihood analysis that uses BK15, Planck, and WMAP maps to separate sky components, we find that adding this predicted leakage to simulations induces a bias of $\\Delta r = 0.0027 \\pm 0.0019$. Future results using higher-quality beam maps and improved techniques to detect such leakage in CMB data will substantially reduce this uncertainty, enabling the levels of systematics control needed for BICEP Array and other experiments that plan to definitively probe large-field inflation.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Transmission spectroscopy is a powerful technique widely used to probe exoplanet terminators. Atmospheric retrievals of transmission spectra are enabling comparative studies of exoplanet atmospheres. However, the atmospheric properties inferred by retrieval techniques display a significant anomaly: most retrieved temperatures are far colder than expected. In some cases, retrieved temperatures are ~1000 K colder than T_eq. Here, we provide an explanation for this conundrum. We demonstrate that erroneously cold temperatures result when 1D atmospheric models are applied to spectra of planets with differing morning-evening terminator compositions. Despite providing an acceptable fit, 1D retrieval techniques artificially tune atmospheric parameters away from terminator-averaged properties. Retrieved temperature profiles are hundreds of degrees cooler and have weaker temperature gradients than reality. Retrieved abundances are mostly biased by > 1$\\sigma$ and sometimes by > 3$\\sigma$, with the most extreme biases for ultra-hot Jupiters. When morning-evening compositional differences manifest for prominent opacity sources, H$_2$O abundances retrieved by 1D models can be biased by over an order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that these biases provide an explanation for the cold retrieved temperatures reported for WASP-17b and WASP-12b. To overcome biases associated with 1D atmospheric models, there is an urgent need to develop multidimensional retrieval techniques.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Our observations show that SN2020bvc shares several properties in common with the Ic-BL SN2006aj, which was associated with the low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (LLGRB) 060218. First, the 10 GHz radio light curve is on the faint end of LLGRB-SNe ($L_\\mathrm{radio} \\approx 10^{37}$erg/s): we model our VLA observations (spanning 13-43 d) as synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic ($v \\gtrsim 0.3c$) forward shock. Second, with Swift and Chandra we detect X-ray emission ($L_X \\approx 10^{41}$erg/s) that is not naturally explained as inverse Compton emission or as part of the same synchrotron spectrum as the radio emission. Third, high-cadence ($6\\times$/night) data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) shows a double-peaked optical light curve, the first peak from shock-cooling emission from extended low-mass material (mass $M<10^{-2} M_\\odot$ at radius $R>10^{12}$cm) and the second peak from the radioactive decay of Ni-56. SN2020bvc is the first confirmed double-peaked Ic-BL SN discovered without a GRB trigger, and shows X-ray and radio emission similar to LLGRB-SNe: this is consistent with models in which the same mechanism produces both the LLGRB and the shock-cooling emission. For four of the five other nearby ($z\\lesssim0.05$) Ic-BL SNe with ZTF high-cadence data, we rule out a first peak like that seen in SN2006aj and SN2020bvc, i.e. that lasts $\\approx 1$d and reaches a peak luminosity $M \\approx -18$. X-ray and radio follow-up observations of future such events will establish whether double-peaked optical light curves are indeed predictive of LLGRB-like X-ray and radio emission.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The Virtual Telescope for X-ray Observations (VTXO) will use lightweight Phase Frensel Lenses (PFLs) in a virtual X-ray telescope with 1 km focal length and with nearly 50 milli-arcsecond angular resolution. Laboratory characterization of PFLs have demonstrated near diffraction-limited angular resolution in the X-ray band, but they require long focal lengths to achieve this quality of imaging. VTXO is formed by using precision formation flying of two SmallSats: a smaller, 6U OpticsSat that houses the PFLs and navigation beacons while a larger, ESPA-class DetectorSat contains an X-ray camera, a charged-particle radiation monitor, a precision star tracker, and the propulsion for the formation flying. The baseline flight dynamics uses a highly-elliptical supersynchronous geostationary transfer orbit to allow the inertial formation to form and hold around the 90,000 km apogee for 10 hours of the 32.5-hour orbit with nearly a year mission lifetime. The guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) for the formation flying uses standard CubeSat avionics packages, a precision star tracker, imaging beacons on the OpticsSat, and a radio ranging system that also serves as an inter-satellite communication link. VTXO's fine angular resolution enables measuring the environments nearly an order of magnitude closer to the central engines of bright compact X-ray sources compared to the current state of the art. This X-ray imaging capability allows for the study of the effects of dust scattering nearer to the central objects such as Cyg X-3 and GX 5-1, for the search for jet structure nearer to the compact object in X-ray novae such as Cyg X-1 and GRS 1915+105, and for the search for structure in the termination shock of in the Crab pulsar wind nebula.

      "We have performed a very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) survey of local (z < 0.05) ultra hard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) using KVN, KaVA, and VLBA. We first executed fringe surveys of 142 BAT-detected AGN at 15 or 22 GHz. Based on the fringe surveys and archival data, we find 10/279 nearby AGN (~4%) VLBI have 22 GHz flux above 30 mJy. This implies that the X-ray AGN with a bright nuclear jet are not common. Among these 10 radio-bright AGN, we obtained 22 GHz VLBI imaging data of our own for four targets and reprocessed archival data for six targets. We find that, although our 10 AGN observed with VLBI span a wide range of pc-scale morphological types, they lie on a tight linear relation between accretion luminosity and nuclear jet luminosity. Our result suggests that a powerful nuclear radio jet correlates with the accretion disc luminosity. We also probed the fundamental plane of black hole activity at VLBI scales (e.g., few milli-arcsecond). The jet luminosity and size distribution among our sample roughly fit into the proposed AGN evolutionary scenario, finding powerful jets after the blow-out phase based on the Eddington ratio (\\lambda_{Edd})-hydrogen column density (N_{H}) relation. In addition, we find some hints of gas inflow or galaxy-galaxy merger in the majority of our sample. This implies that gas supply via tidal interactions in galactic scale may help the central AGN to launch a powerful parsec-scale jet.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "In this paper we introduce a new method for analysing Milky Way phase-space which allows us to reveal the imprint left by the Milky Way bar and spiral arms on the stars with full phase-space data in Gaia Data Release 2. The unprecedented quality and extended spatial coverage of these data enable us to discover six prominent stellar density structures in the disc to a distance of 5 kpc from the Sun. Four of these structures correspond to the spiral arms detected previously in the gas and young stars (Scutum-Centaurus, Sagittarius, Local and Perseus). The remaining two are associated with the main resonances of the Milky Way bar where corotation is placed at around 6.2 kpc and the outer Lindblad resonance beyond the Solar radius, at around 9 kpc. For the first time we provide evidence of the imprint left by spiral arms and resonances in the stellar densities not relying on a specific tracer, through enhancing the signatures left by these asymmetries. Our method offers new avenues for studying how the stellar populations in our Galaxy are shaped.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We present the first remote sensing observations of the impact from a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on the thermodynamic properties of the solar corona between 1 and 3 Rs. Measurements of the Fe XI (789.2 nm) and Fe XIV (530.3 nm) emission were acquired with identical narrow-bandpass imagers at three observing sites during the 2017 August 21 Total Solar Eclipse. Additional continuum imagers were used to observe K+F corona scattering, which is critical for the diagnostics presented here. The total distance between sites along the path of totality was 1400 km, corresponding to a difference of 28 minutes between the times of totality at the first and last site. These observations were used to measure the Fe XI and Fe XIV emission relative to continuum scattering, as well as the relative abundance of Fe 10+ and Fe 13+ from the line ratio. The electron temperature (Te) was then computed via theoretical ionization abundance values. We find that the range of Te is 1.1-1.2 x10^6 K in coronal holes and 1.2-1.4 x10^6 K in streamers. Statistically significant changes of Te occurred throughout much of the corona between the sites as a result of serendipitous CME activity prior to the eclipse. These results underscore the unique advantage of multi-site and multi-wavelength total solar eclipse observations for probing the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the corona over an uninterrupted distance range from 1 to 3 Rs.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Prompt extra power-law (PL) spectral component is discovered in some bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which usually dominates the spectral energy distribution below tens of keV or above $\\sim$10 MeV. However, its origin is still unclear. In this letter, we present a systematic analysis for 13 \\textit{Fermi} short GRBs as of August 2020, with significant keV--MeV and GeV detections at the prompt emission phase. We find that the extra PL component is a ubiquitous spectral feature for short GRBs, showing up in all 13 analyzed GRBs. The PL indices are mostly harder than $-$2.0, which may be well reproduced by considering the electromagnetic cascade induced by ultra-relativistic protons or electrons accelerated in the prompt emission phase. The average flux of these extra PL components positively correlates with that of the main spectral components, which implies they may share the same physical origin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We propose a novel approach to accurately pin down the systematics due to the peculiar velocities of galaxies in measuring the Hubble constant from nearby galaxies in current and future gravitational-wave (GW) standard-siren experiments. Given the precision that future GW standard-siren experiments aim to achieve, the peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies will be a major source of uncertainty. Unlike the conventional backward reconstruction that requires additional redshift-independent distance indicators to recover the peculiar velocity field, we forwardly model the peculiar velocity field by using a high-fidelity mock galaxy catalog built from high-resolution dark matter only (DMO) N-body simulations with a physically motivated subhalo abundance matching technique without introducing any free parameters. Our mock galaxy catalog can impressively well reproduce the observed spectroscopic redshift space distortions (RSDs) in highly non-linear regimes down to very small scales, which is a robust test of the velocity field of our mock galaxy catalog. Based on this mock galaxy catalog, we accurately, for the first time, measure the peculiar velocity probability distributions for the SDSS main galaxy samples. We find that the systematics induced by the peculiar velocities of SDSS like galaxies on the measured Hubble constant can be reduced to below $1\\%$($1\\sigma$) for GW host galaxies with a Hubble flow redshift just above $0.13$, a distance that can be well probed by future GW experiments and galaxy surveys.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will present the next leap forward in gamma-ray astronomy, pushing beyond the present energy frontier to probe beyond 300 TeV. This capability is provided by the 70 Small Sized Telescopes (SSTs). The SSTs are spread across the four square kilometres of the array to detect the rare, but bright, Cherenkov showers produced by the highest-energy gamma rays. One proposed camera design for the SSTs is the Compact High Energy Camera (CHEC). Its compact and curved focal plane design is tailored for dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder telescopes, making it compatible with two of the three telescope proposals for the SSTs. The latest design of CHEC (known as CHEC-S) utilises silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs); an attractive alternative to traditional photomultiplier tubes, offering improved photon detection efficiency and photoelectron counting resolution for a large dynamic range, across tightly-packed pixels. However, SiPMs suffer from the phenomena of optical crosstalk, which degrades the ability to resolve the number of photons incident on the photosensor. CHEC-S also features full-waveform readout at nanosecond sampling resolution with a flexible trigger scheme. This is facilitated by the TARGET (TeV Array Read-out with GSa/s sampling and Event Trigger) modules attached to the SiPMs. This contribution describes the concept and technical design of CHEC-S and displays the key performance results, matched against the criteria required for a CTA camera. The limitation caused by the optical crosstalk of the SiPM is highlighted, and the expected performance with more recent iterations of the photosensor technology is also demonstrated.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

The field of view of the spectrograph is divided into contiguous and parallel spatial bands, each one associated with two opposite sliding metal bars that can be positioned to observe one astronomical object. Thus several objects can be analyzed simultaneously within a configuration of the bars called a mask. Due to the high demand from astronomers, pointing the spectrograph's field of view to the sky, rotating it, and selecting the objects to conform a mask is a crucial optimization problem for the efficient use of the spectrometer. The paper describes this problem, presents a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation for the case where the rotation angle is fixed, presents a non-convex formulation for the case where the rotation angle is unfixed, describes a heuristic approach for the general problem, and discusses computational results on real-world and randomly-generated instances.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We study GeV emission from gamma-ray binaries by assuming that the compact object is a young pulsar. We assume that the relativistic unshocked pulsar wind with Lorentz factor of 10^4~5 can produce the GeV emission by the inverse-Compton scattering process in the dense soft-photon field of the companion star. The travel distance of the unshocked pulsar wind that moves toward the observer depends on the orbital phase of the pulsar. We discuss that the orbital modulation of the GeV emission is a result of combination of the effects of the travel distance of the unshocked pulsar wind and of the anisotropic soft-photon field of the companion star. In this paper, we study how the effect of the travel distance of the unshocked pulsar wind affects to the orbital modulation of GeV emission. We apply our scenario to two gamma-ray binaries, LMC P3 and 4FGL J1405.5-6119. We find that with the suggested system parameters of LMC P3, the observed amplitude of the orbital modulation and the peak width are more consistent with the model light curve by taking into account the effect of the travel distance. For LMC P3, we analyze the GeV spectrum with 8-years Fermi-LAT data and discuss the broadband emission process in X-ray to TeV energy bands. We predict a possible system geometry for 4FGL J1405.5-6119 by fitting the GeV light curve.

      "The Axion Like Particle (ALP) is a hypothetical pseudo-scalar particle beyond the Standard Model, with a compelling possible connection to dark matter and early universe physics. ALPs can be converted into photons via interactions with magnetic fields in the universe, i.e., the so-called inverse Primakoff effect. In this paper, we propose a novel method to explore ALP-induced photons from X-ray data obtained from the {\\it Suzaku} satellite, arising from a possible interaction of ALPs with the direction-dependent Earth's magnetic field viewed from the satellite. {\\it Suzaku} data is suitable for this purpose because its low-altitude Earth orbit result in intrinsically low cosmic-ray background radiation. We study whether the X-ray diffuse background (XDB) spectra estimated from the four deep fields collected over eight years, vary with the integrated Earth's magnetic strength in the direction of each target field at each observation epoch, which amounts to $10^2$ Tm-a value greater than that achieved by terrestrial experiments due to the large coherent length. From the detailed analysis, we did not find evidence of the XDB confidence level spectra having dependence on the Earth's magnetic strength. We obtained 99 % confidence level upper limit on a possible residual contribution to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) surface brightness to be $1.6\\times 10^{-9}~{\\rm ergs~s}^{-1}{\\rm cm}^{-2}{\\rm sr}^{-1}$ normalized at $10^4$ T${}^2$ m${}^2$ in the 2-6 keV range, which corresponds to 6-15 % of the observed CXB brightness, depending on which model of unresolved point sources are used in the interpretation. It is consistent with 80-90 % of the CXB now being resolved into point sources.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Early dynamical evolution of close-in planetary systems is shaped by an intricate combination of planetary gravitational interactions, orbital migration, and dissipative effects. While the process of convergent orbital migration is expected to routinely yield resonant planetary systems, previous analyses have shown that the semi-major axes of initially resonant pairs of planets will gradually diverge under the influence of long-term energy damping, producing an overabundance of planetary period ratios in slight excess of exact commensurability. While this feature is clearly evident in the orbital distribution of close-in extrasolar planets, the existing theoretical picture is limited to the specific case of the planetary three-body problem. In this study, we generalise the framework of dissipative divergence of resonant orbits to multi-resonant chains, and apply our results to the current observational census of well-characterised three-planet systems. Focusing on the 2:1 and 3:2 commensurabilities, we identify three 3-planet systems, whose current orbital architecture is consistent with an evolutionary history wherein convergent migration first locks the planets into a multi-resonant configuration and subsequent dissipation repels the orbits away from exact commensurability. Nevertheless, we find that the architecture of the overall sample of multi planetary systems is incompatible with this simple scenario, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms must play a dominant role during the early stages of planetary systems' dynamical evolution.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Most rocky planets in the galaxy orbit a cool host star, and there is large uncertainty among theoretical models whether these planets can retain an atmosphere. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) might be able to settle this question empirically, but most proposals for doing so require large observational effort because they are based on spectroscopy. Here we show that infrared photometry of secondary eclipses could quickly identify \"candidate\" atmospheres, by searching for rocky planets with atmospheres thick enough that atmospheric heat transport noticeably reduces their dayside thermal emission compared to that of a bare rock. For a planet amenable to atmospheric follow-up, we find that JWST should be able to confidently detect the heat redistribution signal of an O(1) bar atmosphere with one to two eclipses. One to two eclipses is generally much less than the effort needed to infer an atmosphere via transmission or emission spectroscopy. Candidate atmospheres can be further validated via follow-up spectroscopy or phase curves. In addition, because this technique is fast it could enable a first atmospheric survey of rocky exoplanets with JWST. We estimate that the TESS mission will find ~100 planets that are too hot to be habitable but that can be quickly probed via eclipse photometry. Knowing whether hot, rocky planets around M dwarfs have atmospheres is important not only for understanding the evolution of uninhabitable worlds: if atmospheres are common on hot planets, then cooler, potentially habitable planets around M dwarfs are also likely to have atmospheres.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Studying cool star magnetic activity gives an important insight into the stellar dynamo and its relationship with stellar properties, as well as allowing us to place the Sun's magnetism in the context of other stars. Only 61 Cyg A (K5V) and $\\tau$ Boo (F8V) are currently known to have magnetic cycles like the Sun's, where the large-scale magnetic field polarity reverses in phase with the star's chromospheric activity cycles. ${\\tau}$ Boo has a rapid $\\sim$240 d magnetic cycle, and it is not yet clear whether this is related to the star's thin convection zone or if the dynamo is accelerated by interactions between ${\\tau}$ Boo and its hot Jupiter. To shed light on this, we studied the magnetic activity of HD75332 (F7V) which has similar physical properties to ${\\tau}$ Boo and does not appear to host a hot Jupiter. We characterized its long term chromospheric activity variability over 53 yrs and used Zeeman Doppler Imaging to reconstruct the large-scale surface magnetic field for 12 epochs between 2007 and 2019. Although we observe only one reversal of the large-scale magnetic dipole, our results suggest that HD75332 has a rapid $\\sim$1.06 yr solar-like magnetic cycle where the magnetic field evolves in phase with its chromospheric activity. If a solar-like cycle is present, reversals of the large-scale radial field polarity are expected to occur at around activity cycle maxima. This would be similar to the rapid magnetic cycle observed for ${\\tau}$ Boo, suggesting that rapid magnetic cycles may be intrinsic to late-F stars and related to their shallow convection zones.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Stellar populations are powerful tools for investigating the evolution of extragalactic environments. We present the first UV integrated-light spectroscopic observations for 15 young star clusters in the starburst M83 with a special focus on metallicity measurements. The data were obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We analyse the data applying an abundance technique previously used to study an optical set of star clusters. We estimate a central metallicity of [Z] = $+$0.20 $\\pm$ 0.15 dex in agreement with those obtained through independent methods, i.e. $J$-band and blue supergiants. We estimate a UV metallicity gradient of $-$0.041 $\\pm$ 0.022 dex kpc$^{-1}$ consistent with the optical metallicity gradient of $-$0.040 $\\pm$ 0.032 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for $R/R_{25}<0.5$. Combining our stellar metallicities, UV and optical, with those from HII regions (strong-line abundances based on empirical calibrations) we identify two possible breaks in the gradient of M83 at galactocentric distances of $R\\sim0.5$ and $1.0\\:R_{25}$. If the abundance breaks are genuine, the metallicity gradient of this galaxy follows a steep-shallow-steep trend, a scenario predicted by three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations of disc galaxies. The first break is located near the corotation radius. This first steep gradient may have originated by recent star formation episodes and a relatively young bar ($<$1 Gyr). In the numerical simulations the shallow gradient is created by the effects of dilution by outflow where low-metallicity material is mixed with enriched gas. And finally, the second break and last steep gradient mark the farthest galactocentric distances where the outward flow has penetrated.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Context. The Kepler Object of Interest Network (KOINet) is a multi-site network of telescopes around the globe organised for follow-up observations of transiting planet candidate Kepler objects of interest (KOIs) with large transit timing variations (TTVs). The main goal of KOINet is the completion of their TTV curves as the Kepler telescope stopped observing the original Kepler field in 2013.   Aims. We ensure a comprehensive characterisation of the investigated systems by analysing Kepler data combined with new ground-based transit data using a photodynamical model. This method is applied to the Kepler-82 system leading to its first dynamic analysis.   Methods. In order to provide a coherent description of all observations simultaneously, we combine the numerical integration of the gravitational dynamics of a system over the time span of observations with a transit light curve model. To explore the model parameter space, this photodynamical model is coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.   Results. The Kepler-82b/c system shows sinusoidal TTVs due to their near 2:1 resonance dynamical interaction. An additional chopping effect in the TTVs of Kepler-82c hints to a further planet near the 3:2 or 3:1 resonance. We photodynamically analysed Kepler long- and short-cadence data and three new transit observations obtained by KOINet between 2014 and 2018. Our result reveals a non-transiting outer planet with a mass of $m_f=20.9\\pm1.0\\;M_\\bigoplus$ near the 3:2 resonance to the outermost known planet, Kepler-82c. Furthermore, we determined the densities of planets b and c to the significantly more precise values $\\rho_b=0.98_{-0.14}^{+0.10}\\;\\text{g cm}^{-3}$ and $\\rho_c=0.494_{-0.077}^{+0.066}\\;\\text{g cm}^{-3}$.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The non-spherical shapes of dark matter and gas distributions introduce systematic uncertainties that affect observable-mass relations and selection functions of galaxy groups and clusters. However, the triaxial gas distributions depend on the non-linear physical processes of halo formation histories and baryonic physics, which are challenging to model accurately. In this study we explore a machine learning approach for modelling the dependence of gas shapes on dark matter and baryonic properties. With data from the Illustris-TNG hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we develop a machine learning pipeline that applies XGBoost, an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees, to predict radial profiles of gas shapes from halo properties. We show that XGBoost models can accurately predict gas shape profiles in dark matter haloes. We also explore model interpretability with SHAP, a method that identifies the most predictive properties at different halo radii. We find that baryonic properties best predict gas shapes in halo cores, whereas dark matter shapes are the main predictors in the halo outskirts.

      "We combine analytical understanding of resonant dynamics in two-planet systems with machine learning techniques to train a model capable of robustly classifying stability in compact multi-planet systems over long timescales of $10^9$ orbits. Our Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) predicts stability using physically motivated summary statistics measured in integrations of the first $10^4$ orbits, thus achieving speed-ups of up to $10^5$ over full simulations. This computationally opens up the stability constrained characterization of multi-planet systems. Our model, trained on $\\approx 100,000$ three-planet systems sampled at discrete resonances, generalizes both to a sample spanning a continuous period-ratio range, as well as to a large five-planet sample with qualitatively different configurations to our training dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods based on systems' angular momentum deficit, chaos indicators, and parametrized fits to numerical integrations. We use SPOCK to constrain the free eccentricities between the inner and outer pairs of planets in the Kepler-431 system of three approximately Earth-sized planets to both be below 0.05. Our stability analysis provides significantly stronger eccentricity constraints than currently achievable through either radial velocity or transit duration measurements for small planets, and within a factor of a few of systems that exhibit transit timing variations (TTVs). Given that current exoplanet detection strategies now rarely allow for strong TTV constraints (Hadden et al., 2019), SPOCK enables a powerful complementary method for precisely characterizing compact multi-planet systems. We publicly release SPOCK for community use.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

The mock surveys are built from the AbacusCosmos suite of $N$-body simulations, which comprises 40 cosmological volume simulations spanning a range of cosmological models, and we account for uncertainties in galaxy formation scenarios through the use of generalized halo occupation distributions (HODs). We explore a trio of ML models: a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), a power-spectrum-based fully connected network, and a hybrid approach that merges the two to combine physically motivated summary statistics with flexible CNNs. We describe best practices for training a deep model on a suite of matched-phase simulations and we test our model on a completely independent sample that uses previously unseen initial conditions, cosmological parameters, and HOD parameters. Despite the fact that the mock observations are quite small ($\\sim0.07h^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^3$) and the training data span a large parameter space (6 cosmological and 6 HOD parameters), the CNN and hybrid CNN can constrain $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_m$ to $\\sim3\\%$ and $\\sim4\\%$, respectively.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "Dense molecular filaments are central to the star formation process, but the detailed manner in which they fragment into prestellar cores is not yet well understood. Here, we investigate the fragmentation properties and dynamical state of several star-forming filaments in the X-shape Nebula region of the California MC, in an effort to shed some light on this issue. We used multi-wavelength far-infrared images from Herschel and the getsources and getfilaments extraction methods to identify dense cores and filaments and derive their basic properties. We also used a map of $\\rm ^{13}CO (2-1)$ emission from SMT 10m submillimeter telescope to constrain the dynamical state of the filaments. We identified 10 filaments, as well as 57 dense cores. Two star-forming filaments (# 8 and # 10) stand out in that they harbor quasi-periodic chains of dense cores with a typical projected core spacing of $\\sim$0.15 pc. These two filaments have thermally supercritical line masses and are not static. Filament~8 exhibits a prominent transverse velocity gradient, suggesting that it is accreting gas from the parent cloud gas reservoir. In both cases, the observed (projected) core spacing is similar to the filament width and significantly shorter than the canonical separation of $\\sim \\,$4 times the filament width predicted by classical cylinder fragmentation theory. We suggest that continuous accretion of gas onto the two star-forming filaments, as well as geometrical bending of the filaments, may account for the observed core spacing. Our findings suggest that the characteristic fragmentation lengthscale of molecular filaments is quite sensitive to external perturbations from the parent cloud, such as gravitational accretion of ambient material.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) of a galaxy is thought to depend on its star formation rate (SFR). Using a catalogue of observational properties of early-type galaxies (ETGs) and a relation that correlates the formation timescales of ETGs with their stellar masses, the dependencies of the IGIMF on the SFR are translated into dependencies on more intuitive parameters like present-day luminosities in different passbands. It is found that up to a luminosity of approximately $10^9 \\ {\\rm L}_{\\odot}$ (quite independent of the considered passband), the total masses of the stellar populations of ETGs are slightly lower than expected from the canonical stellar initial mass function. However, the actual mass of the stellar populations of the most luminous ETGs may be up to two times higher than expected from an SSP-model with the canonical IMF. The variation of the IGIMF with the mass of ETGs are presented here also as convenient functions of the luminosity in various passbands.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The holographic dark energy models provide an alternative description of the dark energy. These models are motivated by the possible application of holographic principle to the dark energy problem. We study the one parameter Li holographic dark energy and the two parameter Barrow holographic dark energy models using configuration entropy of the matter distribution in the Universe. The configuration entropy rate exhibits a distinct minimum at a specific scale factor that corresponds to the epoch, beyond which the dark energy takes a driving role in the accelerated expansion of the Universe. We find that the location of the minimum and magnitude of the entropy rate at the minimum are sensitive to the parameters of the models. We find the best fit relations between these quantities and the parameters of each model. We propose that these relations can be used to constrain the parameters of the holographic dark energy models from the future measurements of the configuration entropy at multiple redshifts. Further, the Barrow holographic dark energy model is based on Barrow entropy which modifies the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, to capture the deformation of the black-hole surface due to quantum gravitational effects. We find that the location and amplitude of the minimum of the configuration entropy rate is strongly sensitive to the deformation exponent $\\Delta$ in the Barrow model. Our study suggests that signatures of the quantum gravitational effects on the future event horizon may be detected from the study of the configuration entropy of the matter distribution on large-scales.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Of the 1685 SFGs from the GMRT sample, 496 have spectroscopic redshifts whereas 1189 have photometric redshifts. We find that the IRRC of star-forming galaxies, quantified by the infrared-to-1.4 GHz radio luminosity ratio $\\rm{q_{IR}}$, decreases with increasing redshift: $\\rm{q_{IR}\\,=\\,2.86\\pm0.04(1\\,+\\,z)^{-0.20\\pm0.02}}$ out to $z \\sim 1.8$.

      "Since the launch of the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, several hundred gamma-ray pulsars have been discovered, some being radio-loud and some radio-quiet with time-aligned radio and gamma-ray light curves. In the second Fermi Pulsar Catalogue, 117 new gamma-ray pulsars have been reported based on three years of data collected by the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi satellite, providing a wealth of information such as the peak separation~$\\Delta$ of the gamma-ray pulsations and the radio lag~$\\delta$ between the gamma-ray and radio pulses. We selected several radio-loud millisecond gamma-ray pulsars with period~$P$ in the range 2-6~ms and showing a double peak in their gamma-ray profiles. We attempted to constrain the geometry of their magnetosphere, namely the magnetic axis and line-of-sight inclination angles for each of these systems. We applied a force-free dipole magnetosphere from the stellar surface up to the striped wind region -- well outside the light cylinder -- to fit the observed pulse profiles in gamma-rays, consistently with their phase alignment with the radio profile. In deciding whether a fitted curve is reasonable or not, we employed a least-square method to compare the observed gamma-ray intensity with that found from our model, emphasising the amplitude of the gamma-ray peaks, their separation, and the phase lag between radio and gamma-ray peaks. We obtained the best fits and reasonable parameters in agreement with observations for ten millisecond pulsars. Eventually, we constrained the geometry of each pulsar described by the magnetic inclination~$\\alpha$ and the light-of-sight inclination~$\\zeta$. We found that both angles are larger than approximately~$45^{\\rm o}$.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We present a study of flare rates, rotation periods, and spectroscopic activity indicators of 125 single stars within 15 parsecs and with masses between 0.1$-$0.3 $M_\\odot$ observed during the first year of the TESS mission, with the goal of elucidating the relationship between these various magnetically connected phenomena. We gathered multi-epoch high resolution spectra of each target and we measured equivalent widths of the activity indicators Helium I D$_3$, $H\\alpha$, and the Calcium infrared triplet line at 8542.09 angstroms. We present 18 new rotation periods from MEarth photometry and 19 new rotation periods from TESS photometry. We present a catalog of 1392 flares. After correcting for sensitivity, we find the slope of the flare frequency distribution for all stars to have a standard value of $\\alpha$ = 1.98 $\\pm$ 0.02. We determine R$_{31.5}$, the rate of flares per day with energies above E = 3.16$\\times$10$^{31}$ ergs in the TESS bandpass. We find that below a critical value of $H\\alpha$ EW = -0.71 angstroms, log R$_{31.5}$ increases linearly with increasing $H\\alpha$ emission; above this value, log R$_{31.5}$ declines rapidly. The stars divide into two groups: 26% have $H\\alpha$ in emission, high flare rates with typical values of log R$_{31.5}$ = -1.30 $\\pm$ 0.08, and have Rossby numbers $<$ 0.50. The remaining 74% show little to no $H\\alpha$ in emission and exhibit log R$_{31.5}$ $<$ -3.86, with the majority of these stars not showing a single flare during the TESS observations.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "The galactic globular cluster Omega Centauri is the most massive of its kind, with a complex mix of multiple stellar populations and several kinematic and dynamical peculiarities. Different mean proper motions have been detected among the three main sub-populations, implying that the most metal-rich one is of accreted origin. This particular piece of evidence has been a matter of debate because the available data have either not been sufficiently precise or limited to a small region of the cluster to ultimately confirm or refute the result. Using astrometry from the second Gaia data release and recent high-quality, multi-band photometry, we are now in a position to resolve the controversy. We reproduced the original analysis using the Gaia data and found that the three populations have the same mean proper motion.

      "The determination of fundamental parameters of stars is one of the main tasks of astrophysics. For magnetic chemically peculiar stars, this problem is complicated by the anomalous chemical composition of their atmospheres, which requires special analysis methods. We present the results of the effective temperature, surface gravity, abundance and radius determinations for three CP stars HD 188041, HD 111133, and HD 204411. Our analysis is based on a self-consistent model fitting of high-resolution spectra and spectrophrotometric observations over a wide wavelength range, taking into account the anomalous chemical composition of atmospheres and the inhomogeneous vertical distribution for three chemical elements: Ca, Cr, and Fe. For two stars, HD 188041 and HD 204411, we also performed interferometric observations which provided us with the direct estimates of stellar radii. Parameters for another 8 CP stars are collected. Comparison of the radii determined from the analysis of spectroscopic/spectrophotometric observations with direct measurements of the radii by interferometry methods for seven CP stars shows that the radii agree within the limits of measurement errors, which proves indirect spectroscopic analysis capable of proving reliable determinations of the fundamental parameters of fainter Ap stars that are not possible to study with modern interferometric facilities.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

In particular, we show how Taylor methods are capable of satisfying Brouwer's law for the conservation of energy in long-term integrations of planetary systems over billions of dynamical timescales. We also show how close encounters are modelled accurately during simulations of the formation of the Kirkwood gaps and of Apophis' 2029 close encounter with the Earth (where heyoka surpasses the speed and accuracy of domain-specific methods). heyoka can be used from both C++ and Python, and it is publicly available as an open-source project.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "SZ scaling relations have been used to test the self-similar prediction for massive galaxy clusters, but little attention has been given to individual galaxy groups. We investigate the scaling relations of galaxy groups and clusters near the North Ecliptic Pole using X-ray and SZ observations. This region of the sky is where both the ROSAT and Planck satellites achieved their deepest observations, permitting the investigation of lower mass systems. Our sample consists of 62 X-ray detected groups and clusters, spanning a mass range of $10^{13.4}M_{\\odot}<~M_{500}<10^{15}M_{\\odot}$ and redshifts of $0.03\\lesssim z \\lesssim 0.82$. We extract the total SZ flux from unresolved Planck data and estimate the fraction of the SZ flux within $R_{500}$ assuming two different pressure profiles. The SZ scaling relations were derived using a Bayesian technique that accounts for censored data. We find a power law slope of $1.73^{+0.19}_{-0.18}$ for the $Y_{SZ}-M_{500}$ relation which is consistent with the self-similar prediction of 5/3. The slope of $0.89^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$ for the $Y_{SZ}-L_{X,500}$ relation is in agreement with other observational studies but not the self-similar prediction of 5/4, and the $Y_{SZ}-Y_{X}$ relation lies below the 1:1 relation when the slope is fixed to unity. The determined scaling relations are dependent on the selected pressure profile, so resolved data are needed to determine the effects of AGN feedback. In addition, we find a number of potential cluster candidates in the Planck Compton maps that were not identified in our X-ray sample.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "We present a systematic analysis of the extended X-ray emission discovered around 35 FR II radio galaxies from the revised Third Cambridge catalog (3CR) Chandra Snapshot Survey with redshifts between 0.05 to 0.9.   We aimed to (i) test for the presence of extended X-ray emission around FR II radio galaxies, (ii) investigate if the extended emission origin is due to Inverse Compton scattering of seed photons arising from the Cosmic Microwave Background (IC/CMB) or to thermal emission from an intracluster medium (ICM) and (iii) test the impact of this extended emission on hotspot detection.   We investigated the nature of the extended X-ray emission by studying its morphology and compared our results with low-frequency radio observations (i.e., $\\sim$150 MHz), in the TGSS and LOFAR archives, as well as with optical images from Pan-STARRS. In addition, we optimized a search for X-ray counterparts of hotspots in 3CR FR II radio galaxies.   We found statistically significant extended emission ($>$3$\\sigma$ confidence level) along the radio axis for $\\sim$90%, and in the perpendicular direction for $\\sim$60% of our sample. We confirmed the detection of 7 hotspots in the 0.5 - 3 keV.   In the cases where the emission in the direction perpendicular to the radio axis is comparable to that along the radio axis, we suggest that the underlying radiative process is thermal emission from ICM. Otherwise, the dominant radiative process is likely non-thermal IC/CMB emission from lobes. We found that non-thermal IC/CMB is the dominant process in $\\sim$70% of the sources in our sample, while thermal emission from the ICM dominates in $\\sim$15% of them.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",
